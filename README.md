## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- API keys for your preferred AI service(s)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/h1ddenpr0cess20/Tyumi.git
   cd Tyumi
   ```

2. **Open in browser:**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or serve from a local web server for HTTPS features

3. **Android APK (Optional):**
   - Download `tyumi.apk` from the `apk/` directory
   - Install on Android device for a native app experience
   - The APK is a WebView wrapper that runs the web application located at tyumi.app

4. **Configure API Keys:**
   - Click the settings button (⚙️)
   - Navigate to "API Keys" tab
   - Enter your API keys for desired services
   - Keys are stored securely in your browser's local storage

### Ollama Setup (for Local Models)

To use local models, you'll need to set up Ollama:

1. **Install Ollama:**
   - Download and install Ollama from the [official website](https://ollama.com/download).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
   - To use with other network devices, expose Ollama to the network according to the instructions for your platform.
   - Create an HTTPS proxy with local-ssl-proxy or similar tools if you want to use HTTPS, e.g.:
     ```bash
     local-ssl-proxy --hostname <your-hostname> --source 11435 --target 11434 --key key.pem --cert cert.pem
     ```

2. **Pull a Model with Tool Support:**
   - We recommend the Qwen3 model, but you can choose any model with the `tools` label.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     ollama pull qwen3
     ```
   - Browse more models with tool support on the [Ollama model search page](https://ollama.com/search?c=tools).
   - You can use models that do not support tools, but you will not have access to the advanced tool-calling features.


### Using HTTPS (Recommended)

For full functionality, you should serve Tyumi over HTTPS. Here’s how to set up a local HTTPS server with a self-signed certificate:

### 1. Generate a Self-Signed SSL Certificate

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

- When prompted, you can enter dummy values or leave fields blank.
- This will create `key.pem` (private key) and `cert.pem` (certificate) in your current directory.

### 2. Serve Locally with HTTPS

**Using Node.js (http-server):**

First, install `http-server` if you haven’t:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

Then launch with SSL:

```bash
http-server -S -C cert.pem -K key.pem -p 8000
```

**Using Python 3:**

```bash
python -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory . --ssl-certfile cert.pem --ssl-keyfile key.pem
```
*(Note: Native SSL support requires Python 3.10+. For earlier versions, consider using a third-party package like `sslserver`.)*

### 3. Access the App

Open your browser and go to:  
`https://localhost:8000`

You may need to accept a security warning for the self-signed certificate.
