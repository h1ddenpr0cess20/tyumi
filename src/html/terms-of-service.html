          <li>You are solely responsible for obtaining, safeguarding, and managing your API keys</li>
          <li>Tyumi stores these keys only locally in your browser's storage</li>
          <li>Your use of third-party services is subject to their respective terms and conditions</li>
          <li>Charges may apply from third-party providers based on your API usage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Termination</h2>
        <p>You may terminate your use of the Service at any time by ceasing to use the application. We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms of Service.</p>

        <h2>9. Amendments</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of the Service after any changes indicates your acceptance of the new terms.</p>

        <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
