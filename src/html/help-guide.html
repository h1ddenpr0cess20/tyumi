        <h2>Getting Started with Tyumi</h2>
        <p>Tyumi is an open source AI assistant platform that gives you access to multiple AI models from different providers through a unified interface, all while keeping your data private and stored locally on your device.</p>
        
        <h2>Setting Up API Keys</h2>
        <p>To get the most out of Tyumi, you'll need to provide API keys from the AI providers you want to use. These keys allow Tyumi to communicate with the AI services on your behalf.</p>

        <h3>Why You Need API Keys</h3>
        <p>API keys are like digital passwords that give you access to AI services. Each provider requires their own key, and you'll only need keys for the services you intend to use. Your keys are stored securely in your browser's local storage and are never sent to any server other than the respective AI provider's servers.</p>

        <h3>How to Get API Keys</h3>

        <h2>Choosing and Using AI Models</h2>
        <p>Tyumi gives you access to a variety of AI models from different providers. Each model has its own strengths and capabilities.</p>        
            <h3>Available AI Providers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> GPT models for general conversation and tasks</li>
          <li><strong>Anthropic:</strong> Claude models known for safety and reasoning</li>
          <li><strong>Google:</strong> Gemini models with free usage tiers</li>
          <li><strong>Mistral:</strong> Fast, efficient European AI models</li>
          <li><strong>xAI:</strong> Grok models with real-time information from X and the web</li>
          <li><strong>Ollama:</strong> Run open-source models locally</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Model Settings</h3>
        <p>You can customize how models respond by adjusting these parameters:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Controls randomness in responses. Higher values (closer to 1) make responses more creative but potentially less accurate; lower values (closer to 0) make responses more deterministic and focused.</li>
          <li><strong>Top P:</strong> Controls diversity by limiting token selection to the most likely options whose cumulative probability exceeds the top_p value.</li>
          <li><strong>Frequency Penalty:</strong> Reduces repetition by penalizing tokens that have already appeared frequently.</li>
          <li><strong>Presence Penalty:</strong> Encourages new topics by penalizing tokens that have appeared at all, regardless of frequency.</li>
          <li><strong>Max Context:</strong> Controls how many previous messages to include in the conversation context.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Using Advanced Features</h2>

        <h3>Tools and Extensions</h3>
        <p>Tyumi supports various tools that extend the AI's capabilities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Web Search:</strong> Let the AI search for current information online</li>
          <li><strong>Image Generation:</strong> Create images based on text descriptions</li>
          <li><strong>News Search:</strong> Find recent news articles on various topics</li>
          <li><strong>Weather Information:</strong> Get current weather data for locations</li>
          <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> Access stock and financial information</li>
          <li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> Access information about movies, music, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Search for social media content</li>
          <li><strong>Utilities:</strong> Use various helpful tools like calculators, converters, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some tools require specific API keys which you can configure in the Tools API Keys settings section.</p>

        <h3>Text-to-Speech</h3>
        <p>Tyumi can read responses aloud using text-to-speech technology. Click the speaker icon next to a message to hear it spoken.  Requires an OpenAI API key.</p>

        <h3>Theme Customization</h3>
        <p>Personalize your experience by choosing from various themes in the settings panel, including Dark, Light, Metal, Neon, and more.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <h3>Common Issues</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>API Key Errors:</strong> Double-check that your API key is entered correctly and hasn't expired</li>
          <li><strong>Model Not Available:</strong> Ensure you have the appropriate API key for the model you're trying to use</li>
          <li><strong>Ollama Not Connecting:</strong> Verify that Ollama is running locally and that the server URL is correct</li>
          <li><strong>Missing Tool Results:</strong> Check that you've provided any necessary API keys for specific tools</li>
        </ul>
